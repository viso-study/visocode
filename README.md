# VisoCode

> 🙋‍♂️➡️🎞️ VisoCode turns questions into cinematic explanations—powered by AI agents, rendered with Manim.

---

### 🧠 Overview

VisoCode is an **AI-powered explainer engine** that transforms questions into **expert-level animated videos** using a multi-agent pipeline. Whether you're curious about medical AI, calculus or the code base in front of you, Visocode gives you not just an answer, but an explanation you can **see**.

---

### 🔄 How It Works

1. 🙋‍♂️ **You ask a question**
2. 🧠 **ResearchAgent** (powered by **Kimi-K2**) builds an expert explanation using:
   - 🔍 arXiv search
   - 🧮 math/calculation tools
   - 🖼️ icon generation
   - 🧾 structured metadata (sections, visuals, references)
3. 📤 The explanation and metadata are passed to a second agent...
4. 💻 **CodeAgent** (powered by **Gemini**) turns that explanation into:
   - 🎬 Writes frame-accurate Manim scene code
   - 📐 Converts math into LaTeX-rendered visuals
   - 🧩 Coordinates icons, timing, and transitions for clarity
5. 🎞️ **Final Output**: A polished Manim animation that visualizes your question with expert clarity.
