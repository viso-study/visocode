"Sunlight, which appears white to us, is actually made up of all the colors "
"of the rainbow, each with a different wavelength. As sunlight enters the "
"atmosphere, it encounters tiny gas molecules, like nitrogen and oxygen."

#: .\manim\main.py:125
msgid ""
"These molecules scatter sunlight in all directions. This is called Rayleigh "
"scattering. Shorter wavelengths, like blue and violet, are scattered much "
"more effectively than longer wavelengths, like red and orange."

#: .\manim\main.py:193
msgid ""
"Because blue and violet light are scattered all over the sky, our eyes "
"perceive the sky as blue. Violet light is scattered even more, but our eyes "
"are more sensitive to blue, which is why we see a blue sky."

#: .\manim\main.py:210
msgid ""
"Sunsets are red because the longer wavelengths of light are less scattered "
"and can travel directly to our eyes when the sun is low on the horizon."
